## Comparing Canopy Height Metrics Across Three LiDAR Platforms to Support Restoration Monitoring

This repository is intended to contain all the scripts, documentations and data structure for the different remotely sensed LiDAR data.

This project compares canopy height measurements derived from three LiDAR-based remote sensing platforms—airborne LiDAR, drone LiDAR, and mobile laser scanning (MLS). Using data collected from three 50 × 50 m Global Environmental Monitoring (GEM) plots in Borana, Kenya, the study evaluates how each platform captures tree height and vegetation structure.

By comparing LiDAR-derived canopy height metrics with available ground-based measurements, the project aims to identify which platform provides the most reliable information for forest and rangeland restoration monitoring. All datasets come from NATURAL STATE’s research and monitoring work.
