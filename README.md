## Comparing Canopy Height Metrics From Mobile Laser Scanner LiDAR Platform Against Ground-truth Data to Support Restoration Monitoring

This repository is intended to contain all the scripts, documentations and data structure for the LiDAR data.

This project compares canopy height measurements derived from mobile laser scanning (MLS) to Ground-truth data. Using data collected from a 50 × 50 m 'F3' Global Environmental Monitoring (GEM) plot in Borana, Kenya, the study evaluates how each platform captures tree height.

By comparing LiDAR-derived canopy height metrics with available ground-based measurements, the project aims to identify the reliablity of MLS information for forest and rangeland restoration monitoring. All datasets come from NATURAL STATE’s research and monitoring work.
