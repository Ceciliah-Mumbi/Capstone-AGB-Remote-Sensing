# Capstone-AGB-Remote-Sensing
## Comparing Remote Sensing Technologies for Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) Estimation using Ground-truth data
This repository is intended to contain all the scripts, documentations and data structure for the different remotely sensed data for estimation of AGB (my capstone project)

The project evaluates the precision and accuracy of three LiDAR-based remote sensing platforms;
1. Fixed wing airborne LiDAR
2. Drone based LiDAR
3. Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS)

These technologies are compared against ground-truth field biomass measurements collected from three Global Environmental Monitoring plots measuring 50*50 meters in Borana, Kenya.
The goal is to determine which platform provides the most accurate AGB estimates to support restoration monitoring and evidence-based carbon accounting.

The data source is from NATURAL STATE's research and monitoring.
